### Definition:
KCA, also known as **Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA),** is an attack model where the attacker has access only to encrypted messages (ciphertexts) and no corresponding plaintext.

### How it works:
1. The attacker collects ciphertexts.
2. They attempt to deduce information about the plaintext or key using only these ciphertexts.
3. Analysis often relies on statistical properties of the language or expected message format.

### Key Characteristics:
- Requires you know something about the plaintext (eg, itâ€™s English text, an MP3, C source code, etc)
