### Definition:
KPA is an attack model where the attacker has access to both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext.

### How it works:
1. The attacker obtains pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext.
2. They analyze these pairs to find patterns or deduce information about the encryption key.
3. The attacker attempts to use this information to decrypt other messages encrypted with the same key.

### Key Characteristics:
- More powerful than KCA.
- Provides more information to the attacker than KCA.
